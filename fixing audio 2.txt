In hyprland, I needed to insatll blueman manager to see my bluetooth devices with a ui.
Also installed xdg desktop portal for hyprland

AAAAAnd, most importantly, my a2dp was disabled,
yeah, it actually was disabled.

context: headset == a2dp
	handsfree == smth, vule gesi, not imp

I found that in the profiles in pactl list cards 
then ran this command:
	pactl set-card-profile bluez_card.DC_D4_44_0D_A2_36 a2dp-sink
"bluez_card.DC_D4_44_0D_A2_36" is also listed in pactls cards.

it will basically do what it says, set the card profile to a2dp.

And that's the better output device. that's al.
