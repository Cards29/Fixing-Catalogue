I installed the JavaFX SDK, its inside ~/Desktop/GariAche

BUT, in IntellijIdea, I installed a full JDK, it's called Bellsoft Liberica 21 (Full),
the 21 version because its the LTS version.

This JDK comes with all dependencies and other stuff needed for JavaFX,
so I didnt even need to add my installed JavaFX SDK.

I installed Liberica Full inside IntellijIdea, so nothing too complicated, that was it.
