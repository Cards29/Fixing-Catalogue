extracted folder

4. copy that folder to here:
bash
sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/themes/vimix
sudo cp -r ~/downloads/[theme-name] /boot/grub/themes/vimix/

// replace [theme-name] with the folder name that has theme.txt

5.then go to grub in etc update like below:
bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/[theme-name]/theme.txt"
