TODO:
In moving around windows keybind, I can't use j (as I intend to use same arrow movement keybind as vim),
cause right above it, you'll find that $mainMod+J is toggle windows setup, so need to fix that.

I wanna add brightness and bluetooth in waybar.

What I did:
Copied everuthing from typecraft (https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev)
Mainly, used stow to symlink his dotfiles from is repo, the dotfiles folder is in ~/dotfiles/
same case for waybar,

BUT:
my changes:

date: 4/6/2025
in ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc,
I addeed on-click commands for both "clock" item and "network" item
for network, just using nmtui through terminal
for clock, a minimal cli app called calcurse

date: 4/6/2025 (at night)
I added a snippet in hypridle that will suspend and lock the screen when the lid is off.

Learned: we can change cursor/theme from nwg-look, just gotta have the extracted downloaded files in ~/.icons or ~/.themes
