first I installed pipewire again
bash:
sudo pacman -S pipewire pipewire-pulse pipewire-alsa pipewire-media-session wireplumber

then I started the services using systemctl
bash:
systemctl --user enable pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service wireplumber.service
systemctl --user start pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service wireplumber.service

// the enable one is important

we can check status, if it says enabled and running, you're okay
bash:
systemctl --user status pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service wireplumber.service

also u couldnt connect to bluetooth, even after installing packages (gpt it if u dont remember which packages), was because u forgot to make the earpods into pairing mode.


now the main thing, this is what chatGPT said:
"Thanks â€” this confirms the issue: PipeWire sees your audio devices, but no default sink is set, so no application knows where to send sound."

setting my laptop speakers as default
bash:
pactl set-default-sink alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3-platform-skl_hda_dsp_generic.HiFi__Speaker__sink


try this, u should hear "Front Center"
bash:
paplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

now these are chatGPTs saying:
If YouTube or your media player was already playing when you fixed the sink, it may still be routed to a dead one. Move all current audio streams to the new sink

bash:
pactl list short sink-inputs

f you see IDs (like 42, etc.), move them to the speaker

bash:
pactl move-sink-input <ID> alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3-platform-skl_hda_dsp_generic.HiFi__Speaker__sink

// for example replace <ID> with 42, no <> in the main command

that is all, this is 31st May, 2025
