if nwg-look doesn't work, and it probably won't work,


// the thing below is temporary
run this command in the terminal:
hyprctl setcursor <cursor name> <size>

example:
hyprctl setcursor ArcStarry-cursors 24

get the <cursor name> from ~/.icons
just set <size> to 24, it doesn't even work for other values


// to permanently change it (not so parmanent)
just write the same command in autostart in hyprland.conf

for example:
exec-once = hyprctl setcursor ArcStarry-cusors 24
